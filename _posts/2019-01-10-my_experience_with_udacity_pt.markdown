Eu me formei recentemente no [Nanodegree Engenheiro de Aprendizado de Máquina da Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t) e gostaria de compartilhar minha experiência com o programa.

**Vale a pena?**

Se você se encaixa nos items abaixo, **sim**, vale a pena!
* Conhecer Python com as bibliotecas Pandas, Numpy e Matplotlib
* Saber álgebra linear ou não se importar em não entender com profundidade como os algoritmos funcionam matematicamente
* Conhecer conceitos básicos de estatística
* Ter disciplina para aprender com o curso online (reservando tempo para vídeo aulas, exercícios, pesquisa e leitura extra)

### **Backgound**
<br/>
Nos últimos 3 anos, trabalhei como Analista de Dados em uma indústria farmacêutica, tendo como atividade principal a análise estatística, utilizando um software chamado JMP. Meu nível de estatístico já era intermediário e eu programava bem em JMP Scripting Language (JSL). Eu queria fazer um curso online porque eu definitivamente trabalho melhor em casa do que em uma sala de aula, minha curva de aprendizado é muito melhor se eu estudar sozinha, no meu tempo ao invés de um pré determinado.
Pesquisei os melhores cursos em Ciência de Dados e encontrei a Udacity, com um bom nome no mercado e bons comentários dos alunos. Ao escolher os cursos, eu estava entre Ciência de Dados ou Engenheiro de Aprendizado de Máquina. Enviei um e-mail solicitando contato telefônico, no qual fui rapidamente atendida e explicanda o que eu já sabia e minhas lacunas, resolvi iniciar o de Aprendizado de Máquina.

### **Impasses**
<br/>
An impasse was the price, Udacity courses are a bit more expensive compared to other online courses, however I believed that due to the review read plus the course content, it would be worth it. The other obstacle was that I did not know Python, so I took an online course in Portuguese in a week, which gave me enough subsidy to start Nanodegree.
The course for anyone interested was Data Science Academy's [Python Fundamentals for Data Analysis](https://www.datascienceacademy.com.br/course?courseid=python-funds). The course is great for beginners and you can understand very fast doing the exercises.

### **The Nanodegree**
<br/>
The program has 3 modules, a final project plus a few extras. The deadline for doing it is 6 months, being possible to complete before, if you have time to dedicate during the week. You have the right to a weekly support with some instructor and also to use Slack as platform to ask questions with other students and monitors.

**Term 1 - Supervised Learning**

It was the term that I liked the most, it teaches several algorithms of Supervised Learning, like Decision Tree, SVM, Naives Bayes, Emsemble Methods. The classes are very descriptive, shows the advantages, desvatangens and real cases, with examples of easy understanding and you can train with many exercises. There is a final project in each module, which consists of a Jupyter Noteebok in which you follow the guidelines and implement the codes. The project for this term was *Find Donors for CharityML*, in which we must predict whether a person earns more than $ 50,000 or not, for a NGO to get donors. This project makes you reflect a lot and moreover shows more or less how an analysis should be started and finalized. Once the project is submited, in 24 hours it is reviewed showing what you did right or wrong, if something is missing to make it possible to resubmit and they also give you tips on how to improve.	

**Term 2 - Unsupervised Learning**

Here classes are also amazing as the first module, following the same principle. It also covers the concept of **Feature Selection** that I did not have much knowledge of, I learned a lot from this term. The project here was the *Creating Customer Segments*, again using the Jupyter Notebook with the steps it was necessary to separate the customers by segments. It was a little confusing for me because in this case you need to think a lot about Business, however this is essential for anyone doing data analysis, so it was a very useful training.

**Term 3 - Reinforcement Learning**

This module left a little to be desired, the classes were good to a certain extent, then it was very confusing, the video lessons were not as good as the previous modules and the project was very difficult. I had to research VERY MUCH to get the project *Train a quadcopter how to fly* finished. This was a topic that I do not feel prepared for, I will study more deeply now that I have finished the Nanodegree.

**Capstone**

The final project is a free theme, Udacity requests a proposal with some data to be accepted and then the project with all the analyzes. You need to submit a PDF file following a template. My biggest difficulty was finding a dataset and theme, a lot of things went through my head, but in the end I decided to do about Credit Card Fraud Detection, which you can see all the steps [here](https://shiguelita.github.io/projects/2019-01-02-credit_card_fraud_detection/). The project was a huge learning, get the data, how to start the analysis, get a better model than the Benchmark from Kaggle, it was really a wonderful experience.

**Extra Modules**

The above modules are mandatory to get the certificate, but Udacity offers some extra content such as:
* **Support material**: here are classes on basic statistics, libraries Pandas, Numpy and scikit-learn (my tip is to complete this module first)
* **Evaluation and validation of models**: you'll learn model concepts, how to train them, some evaluation metrics, and how to select a model
* **Deep Learning**: this is the first module of [Nanodegree in Deep Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101), following the same concept of Term 1 and 2 of Machine Learning. Very good module! You learn about neural networks with Keras. The project of this module was *Dog-Breed Classifier*.

### **Tips**
<br/>
Here are some tips to follow during the course:
* Reserve some time each week, do not watch classes with large time spacing  between them
* When learning about a new algorithm, summarize the advantages, disadvantages, when to use it and real cases. Believe you will need this! I will post mu cheat sheet in this blog.
* Whenever you are in doubt about any content, research for more, read articles, blogs, see examples or schedule a monitoring.
* In projects try to do it alone, even if you are having difficulties do not look at the codes of other students. You can set up monitoring to ask for help, but try to do as much as you can, this will bring you more learning.



That's it! For me the course was worth every cent invested ^^
