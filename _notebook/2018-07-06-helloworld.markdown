I am Talita Shiguemoto and welcome to my blog!

The goal of this blog is essentially to **learn**, there are still many things I need to know, so I decided to write the process of my studies and then follow my development.
I hope that with this I can help some people who are looking to develop their knowledge in Data Science and also that I can learn from you!

A little more about me: I graduated in Mathematics at Metodista University, I work with data analysis since 2015 and currently I am taking graduate studies in Big Data Analysis in FIA University.

Some of my interests are: data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, games, books, tea, and travel.

That's it, time to start!
