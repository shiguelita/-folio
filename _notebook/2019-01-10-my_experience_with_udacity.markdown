I recently graduated from [Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t) and I would like to share my experience I had with the program.

**Is it worth?**

If you know the items below, **yes**, it's worth it!
* Know Python with the Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib libraries
* Know linear algebra or do not mind to understand in depth how algorithms work mathematically
* Basic statistics concepts
* Discipline to learn with online course (reserving time for video lessons, exercises, research and extra reading)

### **Backgound**
<br/>
Over the past 3 years, I worked as Data Analyst in a pharmaceutical industry, having as main activity the statistical analysis, using a software called JMP. My statistics level was already intermediate and I could code well in JMP Scripting Language (JSL). I wanted to take an online course because I definitely work better at home than in a classroom, my learning curve is a lot better if I study alone, in my time rather than a pre-set.
I researched the best courses in Data Science and found Udacity, with a good name on the market and good student comments. In choosing the courses, I was between Data Science or Machine Learning Engineer. I sent an e-mail requesting telephone contact, in which I was quickly answered and explaining what I already knew and my gaps, I decided to start the Machine Learning.

### **Impasses**
<br/>
An impasse was the price, Udacity courses are a bit more expensive compared to other online courses, however I believed that due to the review read plus the course content, it would be worth it. The other obstacle was that I did not know Python, so I took an online course in Portuguese in a week, which gave me enough subsidy to start Nanodegree.
The course for anyone interested was Data Science Academy's [Python Fundamentals for Data Analysis](https://www.datascienceacademy.com.br/course?courseid=python-funds). The course is great for beginners and you can understand very fast doing the exercises.

### **The Nanodegree**
<br/>
The program has 3 modules, a final project plus a few extras. The deadline for doing it is 6 months, being possible to complete before, if you have time to dedicate during the week. Você tem direito a um suporte semanal com algum instrutor e também utilizar o *Slack* como plataforma para tirar dúvidas com outros alunos e monitores.

**Term 1 - Supervised Learning**

It was the term that I liked the most, it teaches several algorithms of Supervised Learning, like Decision Tree, SVM, Naives Bayes, Emsemble Methods. The classes are very descriptive, shows the advantages, desvatangens and use cases, with examples of easy understanding and you can train with many exercises. There is a final project in each module, which consists of a Jupyter Noteebok in which you follow the guidelines and implement the codes. The project for this term was *Find Donors for CharityML*, in which we must predict whether a person earns more than $ 50,000 or not, for an NGO to get donors. This project makes you reflect a lot and moreover shows more or less how an analysis should be started and finalized. Once the project is submited, in 24 hours it is reviewed showing what you did right or wrong, if something is missing to make it possible to resubmit and they also give you tips on how to improve.	

**Term 2 - Unsupervised Learning**

Here classes are also amazing as the first module, following the same principle. It also covers the concept of **Feature Selection** that I did not have much knowledge of, I learned a lot from this term. The project here was the *Creating Customer Segments*, again using the Jupyter Notebook with the steps it was necessary to separate the customers by segments. It was a little confusing for me because in this case you need to think a lot about Business, however this is essential for anyone doing data analysis, so it was a very useful training.

**Term 3 - Reinforcement Learning**

This module left a little to be desired, the classes were good to a certain extent, then it was very confusing, the video lessons were not as good as the previous modules and the project was very difficult. I had to research VERY MUCH to get the project *Train a quadcopter how to fly* finished. This was a topic that I do not feel prepared for, I will study more deeply now that I have finished the Nanodegree.

**Capstone**

The final project is a free theme, Udacity requests a proposal with some data to be accepted and then the project with all the analyzes. You need to submit a PDF file following a template. My biggest difficulty was finding a dataset and theme, a lot of things went through my head, but in the end I decided to do about Credit Card Fraud Detection, which you can see all the steps [here](https://shiguelita.github.io/projects/2019-01-02-credit_card_fraud_detection/). The project was a huge learning, get the data, how to start the analysis, get a better model than the Benchmark from Kaggle, it was really a wonderful experience.

**Extra Modules**

Os módulos acimas são obrigatórios para conseguir o certificado, porém a Udacity disponibiliza alguns conteúdos extras como:
* **Support material**: here are classes on basic statistics, libraries Pandas, Numpy and scikit-learn (my tip is to complete this module first)
* **Evaluation and validation of models**: you'll learn model concepts, how to train them, some evaluation metrics, and how to select a model
* **Deep Learning**: this is the first module of [Nanodegree in Deep Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101), following the same concept of Term 1 and 2 of Machine Learning. Very good module! You learn about neural networks with Keras. The project of this module was *Dog-Breed Classifier*.

### **Tips**
<br/>
Here are some tips to follow during the course:
* Reserve some time each week, do not watch classes with large time spacing  between them
* When learning about a new algorithm, summarize the advantages, disadvantages, when to use it and use cases. Believe you will need this! I will post mu cheat sheet in this blog.
* Whenever you are in doubt about any content, research for more, read articles, blogs, see examples or schedule a monitoring.
* In projects try to do it alone, even if you are having difficulties do not look at the codes of other students. You can set up monitoring to ask for help, but try to do as much as you can, this will bring you more learning.



That's it! For me the course was worth every cent invested ^^
